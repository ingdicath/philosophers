# philosophers

CODAM project Curriculum 2019.

- **Project type**: Unix logic.
- **Objective**: Learn the basics of _threading_ a process and how to manage shared memory between threads, including the use of _mutex_.
---
## Requirements

Write the program in C.

### Description

- One or more philosophers are sitting at a round table doing one of three things:
`eating`, `thinking`, or `sleeping`.
- The philosophers sit at a circular table with a bowl of spaghetti in the center with some forks on the table.
- A philosopher must eat with two forks, one for each hand.
- The philosophers must never be starving and each one needs to eat.
- Don't speak each other and don't know when other will die.
- After finished eating, the philosopher will drop his forks and start sleeping, and when finished, will start thinking.
- Simulation stops when a philosopher dies or if all philosophers have eaten at least a certain number of times.
